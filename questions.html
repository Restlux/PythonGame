        <div class="section">
            <h2>Pygame-Specific Questions</h2>

            <p><span class="question-number">6.</span> <span class="question">Why do you use `pygame.display.set_mode()` and how is it related to fullscreen mode in your project?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The student should describe the usage of `pygame.display.set_mode()` to create a display window, and the `pygame.FULLSCREEN` flag to make it fullscreen.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">7.</span> <span class="question">What is the role of `pygame.mask.from_surface()` in your game, and how does it help with collision detection?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The student should explain how `pygame.mask.from_surface()` generates a mask from an image, which is used to detect precise pixel-based collisions.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">8.</span> <span class="question">Why did you choose to use `pygame.transform.scale()` to resize images? How does it improve your game's performance or visual quality?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The student should explain the need for scaling images to fit the screen size and how it affects performance and visuals, especially when working with different screen sizes.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">9.</span> <span class="question">How does `pygame.font.SysFont()` help in rendering text in the game, and why did you use it for the level and health bars?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The student should explain how they use `pygame.font.SysFont()` to render dynamic text (such as displaying the level or player health) and why it’s helpful in creating interactive UI elements.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">10.</span> <span class="question">What are the differences between `pygame.draw.rect()` and `pygame.blit()`? When would you use each in a game project like this?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The student should explain that `pygame.draw.rect()` is used to draw simple geometric shapes (like health bars) while `pygame.blit()` is used to draw images (like player ships or enemies).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Game Mechanics and Implementation</h2>

            <p><span class="question-number">11.</span> <span class="question">How do you handle player movement in your game? What kind of input method does your game use for controlling the player?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The student should explain how they use the keyboard to move the player (with arrow keys or WASD), and how `pygame.key.get_pressed()` is used to capture key states.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">12.</span> <span class="question">Can you explain the shooting mechanic in your game? How does the laser shooting and cooldown system work?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The student should describe how lasers are created and moved, and how the cooldown system prevents the player from firing too rapidly.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">13.</span> <span class="question">How are enemies spawned and how does their behavior change as the game progresses (i.e., wave system)?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The student should explain the logic behind spawning enemies in waves, including how the number and speed of enemies increase as the game progresses.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">14.</span> <span class="question">What happens when a player’s health reaches zero? How is the loss condition handled in the game?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The student should explain that when the player’s health reaches zero, the `lost` flag is set to `True`, triggering a "You Lost" screen.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">15.</span> <span class="question">How do you handle the player losing lives when an enemy goes off the screen?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The student should describe the process of checking if an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen and how the player loses a life when that happens.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Performance and Optimization</h2>

            <p><span class="question-number">16.</span> <span class="question">How does the use of `pygame.time.Clock()` help in controlling the frame rate and ensuring smooth gameplay?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The student should explain that `pygame.time.Clock()` is used to control the FPS, ensuring the game runs at a consistent rate, which is crucial for smooth animations and gameplay.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Python-Specific Questions</h2>

            <p><span class="question-number">20.</span> <span class="question">What is a class in Python, and how is it different from an object?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances), while an object is an instance of a class that contains data (attributes) and functions (methods).</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">21.</span> <span class="question">What is the purpose of the `__init__` method in Python?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The `__init__` method is the constructor in Python. It is automatically called when a new object (instance) of a class is created, and it is used to initialize the object’s attributes.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">22.</span> <span class="question">Can you explain the concept of inheritance in Python, and how it is used in your game?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">Inheritance allows one class (the child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (the parent class). In the provided code, `Player` and `Enemy` inherit from the `Ship` class to reuse common functionality like movement and shooting.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">23.</span> <span class="question">What is the difference between `self` and other variables in a class?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">`self` is a reference to the current instance of the class. It allows access to instance variables and methods. Other variables can be local variables or parameters passed into methods.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">24.</span> <span class="question">Explain how you used methods in the `Ship` class. What does each method do?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The `Ship` class has several methods, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>draw()</strong>: Renders the ship’s image and lasers on the screen.</li>
                    <li><strong>move_lasers()</strong>: Moves the ship's lasers and handles collisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>shoot()</strong>: Creates a new laser and adds it to the list of lasers.</li>
                    <li><strong>cooldown()</strong>: Prevents the player from shooting too rapidly by controlling the shooting cooldown.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p><span class="question-number">25.</span> <span class="question">What does `super().__init__()` do in the `Player` and `Enemy` classes?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">`super().__init__()` calls the `__init__` method of the parent class (`Ship`). This allows the child classes (`Player`, `Enemy`) to inherit the attributes and methods from `Ship`, such as the `x`, `y`, `health`, and `ship_img` attributes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Functions</h2>

            <p><span class="question-number">26.</span> <span class="question">What is the purpose of a function in Python?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It helps in organizing code, making it modular, and reducing redundancy.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">27.</span> <span class="question">Can you explain the difference between a method and a function in Python?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">A method is a function that is associated with an object or class, while a function is a block of code that can exist independently. Methods operate on instance data, while functions generally perform independent tasks.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">28.</span> <span class="question">What is the purpose of the `cooldown()` function in the `Ship` class, and how does it prevent rapid firing?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The `cooldown()` function checks if the cooldown counter has reached the limit (set by `COOLDOWN`). If it has, it resets the counter; if not, it increments it. This mechanism prevents the player from shooting continuously without delay.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">29.</span> <span class="question">How does the `move_lasers()` method work in the `Ship` class?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The `move_lasers()` method moves each laser in the list by a given velocity, checks if it is off-screen (using `off_screen()`), and handles collisions with objects (such as enemies). If a laser collides with an enemy, the laser is removed from the list.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">30.</span> <span class="question">What is the role of the `random.randrange()` function in the code, and how is it used?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">`random.randrange()` generates a random integer within a specified range. In the code, it is used to randomly spawn enemies at different positions and for random enemy behavior, such as shooting.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">31.</span> <span class="question">What does the `collide()` function do, and how does it help with collision detection?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The `collide()` function checks if two objects (such as the player and an enemy) overlap by comparing their masks, which represent the non-transparent pixels of their images. If they overlap, the function returns `True`, indicating a collision.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Lists and Data Structures</h2>

            <p><span class="question-number">32.</span> <span class="question">Why do you use lists (e.g., `self.lasers` and `enemies`) in this project, and what are the advantages?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">Lists are used to store dynamic collections of objects, such as lasers and enemies. The main advantages are that lists allow for easy addition, removal, and iteration over elements, which is crucial for handling in-game objects like lasers and enemies that are created and destroyed frequently.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">33.</span> <span class="question">How do you handle removing lasers and enemies from the game?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">Lasers are removed from the list if they go off-screen or if they collide with an enemy. Enemies are removed if they are hit by a laser or if they go off the bottom of the screen. The `remove()` method is used to remove objects from the list.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conditional Statements and Loops</h2>

            <p><span class="question-number">34.</span> <span class="question">How does the `if keys[pygame.K_SPACE]` conditional control the player’s shooting behavior?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The `if keys[pygame.K_SPACE]` checks if the spacebar is pressed, and if it is, the `shoot()` method is called. This method creates a laser and adds it to the list of lasers.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">35.</span> <span class="question">Explain the use of the `for` loop in the `move_lasers()` method and how it iterates through the list of lasers.</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The `for` loop iterates over the list of lasers. For each laser, it moves the laser by a given velocity, checks if it is off-screen, and handles collisions with objects (such as enemies). If a laser collides with an enemy, the laser is removed from the list.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">36.</span> <span class="question">How does the `while run:` loop control the flow of the game, and what role does the `pygame.event.get()` function play in it?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">The `while run:` loop is the main game loop. It repeatedly checks for events (like player input and window events) using `pygame.event.get()`, updates the game state, and redraws the window. If an event like quitting is detected, it exits the loop.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Error Handling and Debugging</h2>

            <p><span class="question-number">37.</span> <span class="question">What would happen if you forget to call `pygame.init()` before running your game, and how would you troubleshoot this?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">If `pygame.init()` is not called, none of the Pygame modules would be initialized, and the program would throw an error when trying to use Pygame functions like `pygame.display.set_mode()`. To troubleshoot, you would check that `pygame.init()` is properly called before any Pygame functionality is used.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">38.</span> <span class="question">Explain how you would debug a situation where the player’s ship is not moving correctly in the game.</span></p>
            <p class="answer">To debug this, I would check the movement logic (such as the `if` conditions inside the movement block), make sure the key events are being captured correctly using `pygame.key.get_pressed()`, and verify that the player’s position is being updated as expected.</p>

            <p><span class="question-number">39.</span> <span class="question">How do you handle situations where an enemy goes off the screen in your game?</span></p>
            <p class="answer">When an enemy goes off the screen (i.e., when its `y` coordinate exceeds the screen height), the player's life is reduced, and the enemy is removed from the list of enemies. This is handled inside the game loop with a conditional check.</p>
