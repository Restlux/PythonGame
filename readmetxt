1. Initialization:
   - pygame.init(): Initializes all the Pygame modules.

2. Display:
   - pygame.display.set_mode((width, height), flags): Creates a window or screen for the game, with optional flags (e.g., pygame.FULLSCREEN for full-screen mode).
   - pygame.display.set_caption("Title"): Sets the window title.
   - pygame.display.update(): Updates the contents of the display. This is necessary to render the drawn elements.

3. Images:
   - pygame.image.load('filename'): Loads an image from a file.
   - pygame.transform.scale(image, (width, height)): Resizes an image to the specified width and height.
   - screen.blit(image, (x, y)): Draws an image onto the screen at the specified coordinates.

4. Sound:
   - pygame.mixer.Sound('filename'): Loads a sound file.
   - sound.play(): Plays the loaded sound.
   - pygame.mixer.init(): Initializes the Pygame sound mixer (implicitly done with pygame.init()).

5. Input Handling:
   - pygame.event.get(): Gets the list of events that have occurred since the last call.
   - pygame.key.get_pressed(): Returns a list of keys that are currently pressed.

6. Game Loop Control:
   - for event in pygame.event.get(): Iterates through all the events in the queue.
   - running = True: Sets a variable to keep the game loop running.
   - running = False: Exits the game loop.

7. Collision Detection:
   - math.sqrt(): Calculates the square root for determining distance.
   - math.pow(base, exp): Raises a number to a power, used to calculate squared distances.

8. Graphics and Rendering:
   - screen.blit(...): Used to draw images and text onto the screen.
   - font.render("text", True, (r, g, b)): Creates a surface with the text to be drawn.

9. Delays and Timing:
   - pygame.time.delay(milliseconds): Delays for a given amount of time.
   - pygame.time.Clock(): Creates a clock object to manage how fast the game runs (though not used in the provided code, it can be helpful for frame rate control).

10. Quit:
    - pygame.quit(): Uninitializes all Pygame modules and quits the game.
